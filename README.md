# ElfCode Language Support for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides support for the ElfCode language from Advent of Code 2018. The actual language is described [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/16) and [here](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/19). The only thing I added is the ability to add line comments, which start with a percentage sign (`%`).

The extension currently supports:
* Syntax highlighting
* Code snippets
* Some source code validation

## But why?
In the spirit of Christmas I decided to try out something new. I have never created a vscode extension before and I saw ElfCode as a pretty good opportunity to learn something new, since the language is quite simple. So I took the time to actually make this, don't judge me :)

I am also interested in actually making the code run with a debugger or something. I started looking into it but haven't had the time to finish yet. Maybe I'll come back to it a bit later.
